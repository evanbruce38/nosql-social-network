# NoSQL Social Network

## Description
  
  * For this assignment I created a nosql server social media application. This assignment included no starter code and I was tasked with creating the backend of the app that allows you to create, update, delete, and view all users. Allows users to become friends with other users. Create thoughts they would like to share with other users. And create reactions to other users thoughts. There is no front end for this assignment, thanks for checking out my work!
